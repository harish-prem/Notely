# Notely

![Notely demo](DEMO_IMAGE.png)

A web-based Markdown note-taking app with tagging, search, sorting, PDF export, and OAuth 2.0 authentication via AWS Cognito. Built with [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io) and served as a self-hosted web server.

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete Markdown notes in a browser UI
- Tag notes and filter by tag
- Full-text search and sorting (by date edited, date created, or name)
- Export notes to PDF
- OAuth 2.0 login flow backed by AWS Cognito
- Notes stored as plain `.md` files with YAML front-matter — no database required
- Docker Compose support for one-command deployment

## Usage

```

Tests run in parallel across all available CPU cores via `pytest-xdist`.
